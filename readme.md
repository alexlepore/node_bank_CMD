# Bank CLI App

This app uses the basic functionality found at the bank.

Included in the bank.js file are four functions: total, deposit, withdraw, and lotto.

Total adds the current amount found in the bank.txt file.

Deposit will add funds to the bank.txt file(or the account given the context).

Withdraw will subtract funds.

The lotto command gives the user the option of gambling a small fee for a possible prize.

After downloading commands can be used as follows: node bank.js total, or node bank.js deposit 25, and so on.
